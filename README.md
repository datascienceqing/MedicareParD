## MedicareParD 2014 Analysis

This is a data analysis on MedicarePartD data set using SAS. The data can be downloaded from [this link.](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/Part-D-Prescriber.html) 

In first analysis, I tried to answer 7 questions that listed in the PartD_analysis_code.txt file. These questions covered beneficiaries distribution, drug usage among specialties and state, as well as changes of providers between 2013 and 2014.

In another analysis, I tried to compare the opioid description among female and male doctors in different states. The three bar charts (chart1 - chart3) showed the average count of beneficiaries who were described opioid, the difference of total count of beneficiaries who were described opioid by male providers and female providers ('male - female'), and the average count difference.
